            <h2>Chapter 4: Digital Well-being Vision and Practice</h2>
            <p>This chapter focuses on creating a personal vision for your digital well-being and implementing practical strategies to achieve it.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Defining Your Digital Well-being Vision</h3>
            <p>Start by reflecting on what a healthy and balanced digital life looks like for you. Consider your values, goals, and priorities.</p>

            <h3>4.2 Setting Realistic Goals</h3>
            <p>Break down your vision into smaller, achievable goals. For example, "Reduce social media usage by 30 minutes per day" or "Spend one hour each day without any screens."</p>

            <h3>4.3 Practical Strategies for Implementation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time Blocking:</strong> Schedule specific times for digital activities and stick to them.</li>
                <li><strong>App Limits:</strong> Use built-in features or third-party apps to limit your time on distracting apps.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Detox:</strong> Plan regular breaks from technology, such as a weekend without screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Mindful Technology Use:</strong> Be present and intentional when using technology. Avoid mindless scrolling.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.4 Monitoring and Adjusting Your Approach</h3>
            <p>Regularly evaluate your progress and make adjustments as needed. What's working? What's not? Be flexible and adapt your strategies to fit your changing needs.</p>

            <h3>4.5 Seeking Support</h3>
            <p>Connect with others who are also working on their digital well-being. Share your experiences and learn from each other.</p>
